# Movie UI React App

## Project Background

To continue strengthening my skills, I wanted to create a functional application that was similar to interfaces seen on various streaming sites, with content provided by The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

As this project is ongoing, I will be layering on new features and content over time. Currently, the application displays the top 5 most popular recent movies, and basic details with TMDB reviews.

##Features
###Initial Mockup - 5/11/2019
Mocked up layout of the movies front page.

###v1.0 - 5/12/2019
Rendered React components to drive the following features:

- Main page lists top 5 movies.
- #1 Movie is featured in the hero banner.
- #2-4 Movies featured in a grid below.
- Movie detail display with backdrop image, poster, overview, and reviews list.

##Tech Stack
###Back End
The back end is served using Node/Express with a basic internal API that can be used to make the necessary to TMDB API, and tweak the data returned for use within the Movie UI React App.

###Front End
The UI is developed using React 16 with Sass preprocessing built in. No other CSS frameworks are usedâ€”the UI is being coded entirely from scratch with the React components in mind.
